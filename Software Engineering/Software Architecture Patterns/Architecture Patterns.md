**High-level problems** are solved with [[Architecture Patterns]]. They are reusable solutions that **defines how** the **components** of a System **have to be structured**, how they **interact between themselves** and how the **system meets requirements such** as **scalability, maintainability, performance**, and **security**.
### Most used Architecture Patterns
- [[Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)]]
- [[Layered Architecture (n-Tier Architecture)]]
- [[Microservices Architecture]]
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Serverless Architecture
- CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

### What about [[Clean Architecture]]? Is this an Architecture Pattern?
Although is called an **Architecture Pattern**, from my perspective, **this is** more like a amount of Philosophies reunited. Its idea can be seem in other real architectures like [[Layered Architecture (n-Tier Architecture)]] and [[Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)]].

#### Benefits of using Architecture Patterns in your project
1. **Scalability**: Designed to handle growing workloads.
2. **Maintainability**: Clear structure simplifies updates and debugging.
3. **Reusability**: Components or patterns can be reused across projects.
4. **Testability**: Clear separation of concerns makes testing individual parts easier.
5. **Flexibility**: Facilitates adapting to changing requirements or technologies.

==**Advise: Before choose an Architecture Pattern you have to consider the actual state of your project (Whether its viable to implement), the Team Expertise (Whether they know the chosen Pattern) and the Complexity of your project (Whether its just a simple project or a big complex one).**==
